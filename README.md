## K1-K4
The Kryptos sculpture is devided into four different segments with names, K1, K2, K3, and K4. The tree first segments have been solved, but the segment (K4) is still unsolved (2025-12-29).

## K4
The K4 cipher is a 97-character-long text. Clues to K4 have been given by the creator of the sculpture. Entering the clues into the cipher gives the following results, where '.' represents the target for solving and '-' represents the part of the solved K3.
- EAST
- NORTHEAST
- BERLIN
- CLOCK

A - is the plain text, and B - is the encoded result.

## Final Words
I created this repo as a fun evening project to render the ciphers in an HTML table. There may be errors in the information and/or visualization, and some details may not be exactly as they appear in the sculpture.
